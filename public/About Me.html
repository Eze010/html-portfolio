<h1>ABOUT ME (EZE)</h1>
<p>My name is Eze Evans Chibuike, born on the 5th day of July 2004. I'm an indegeine of Enugu state by birth and Lagos State by residence; I have lived in Nigeria all my life and i'm currently schooling in the University Of Nigeria, Nsukka; a prestigious University in Nigeria.</p>
<p>My discipline (Computer With Statistics) is a four year programme and i'm currently in my 2nd year. At the moment, i'm an investor. I know by now you would be wondering what kind of investor i am and what i invests in. I invest in the Kingdom of my Father (GOD) and i also invest in relationships with men and right now i'm a growing web developer.</p>
<p>I've had experiences of different shades in the past which have contributed in my grooming and growth; I've been stretched and learned discipline both from my biological and spiritual family. As time goes on and as God will have it, you will know a whole lot more about me when we start working together fully.</p>
